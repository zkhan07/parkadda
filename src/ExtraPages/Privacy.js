            shall not be divulged to any third party, unless legally required to
            do so to the appropriate authorities, or if necessary to ensure

            policy.
            <br />
            <h4>Disclosure of your information to third parties</h4>
            <br />
            7.1. Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure
            that all of your Personal Information shall never be disclosed in
            ways other than those described in this Privacy Policy. Although we
            use industry-standard practices to protect your privacy, We do not
            promise, and you should not expect, that your personally
            identifiable information or private communications would always
            remain private. <br />
            <br /> i. Other Corporate Entities: We share much of our data,
            including your Personal Information with our parent and/or
            subsidiaries that are committed to serving your needs through the
            use of ParkAdda services. Such data shall be shared for the sole
            purpose of enhancing your experience of using the platform. To the
            extent that these entities have access to your information, they
            shall treat it at least as protective as they treat information they
            obtain from their other members. It is possible that we and/or our
            subsidiaries, or any combination of such, could merge with or be
            acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination
            occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your
            information in order to continue to provide the service. You shall
            receive notice of such an event (to the extent it occurs).
            <br />
            <br /> ii. Law and order: We cooperate with law enforcement
            inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as
            intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can, and
            you so authorize us to disclose your personal information to law
            enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole
            discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an
            investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or
            other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to any legal
            liability. <br />
            <br />
            7.2. Information that you make publicly available on the platform
            may be potentially viewed by any party, and by posting such material
            it is deemed that you consent to share such information with such
            parties.
            <br />
            <h4> Accessing, Reviewing and Changing your profile</h4>
            <br />
            8.1. Following registration, you can review and change the
            information you submitted at the stage of registration, except your
            display name/username. An option for facilitating such change shall
            be present on the platforms and such change shall be facilitated by
            the user, if you change any information, we may keep track of your
            old information.
            <br />
            <br />
            8.2. We shall retain in our files, the information You have
            requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve
            disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and
            conditions. Further, such prior information is never completely
            removed from our database due to technical and legal constraints,
            including stored ‘backup’ systems. Therefore, you should not expect
            that all of your personally identifiable information shall be
            completely removed from our databases in response to Your requests.
            <br />
            <h4> Security</h4>
            <br />
            9.1. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss
            and unauthorized access. We employ many different security
            techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members
            inside and outside ParkAdda. We follow generally accepted industry
            standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us and
            information that we have accessed. However, “perfect security” does
            not exist on the internet. You, therefore, agree that any security
            breaches beyond the control of our standard security procedures are
            at your sole risk and discretion.
            <br />
            <h4> Indemnity</h4>
            <br /> 10.1. You agree and undertake to indemnify us in any suit or
            dispute by any third party arising out of disclosure of personal
            information by you to third parties either through the platform or
            otherwise and your use and access of websites and resources of third
            parties. We assume no liability for any actions of third parties
            with regard to your personal information, which you may have
            disclosed to such third parties.
            <br />
            <h4>Severability</h4>
            <br />
            11.1. Each paragraph of this privacy policy shall be and remain
            separate from and independent of and severable from all and any
            paragraphs herein except where otherwise expressly indicated or
            indicated by the context of the agreement. The decisions or
            declaration that one or more of the paragraphs are null and void
            shall have no effect on the remaining paragraphs of this privacy
            policy.
            <br />
            <h4> Amendment</h4>
            <br />
            12.1. Our privacy policy may change from time to time. Hence we
            shall post any privacy policy change on our platform or notify you
            by email / App notification.
